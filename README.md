# NLDI Crawler

This is a **work in progress**

This is to be a python port of the [nldi crawler](https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-crawler).
It is used to ingest data from various sources and link it to the network if it is not already.
The only requirement is that the source system is able to provide GeoJSON via a web request
with the necessary attributes.

See the documentation [here](https://gzt5142.github.io/nldi-crawler-py/) for details of function, including design and usage.
